# tofu65v2_macos

## Overview

This QMK keyboard firmware is for [KBDFans](https://kbdfans.com) Tofu65 2.0 (Tofu Jr PCB) adapted for macOS.

This firmware is modified from the original Tofu Jr v1 firmware. See [here](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/dztech/tofu/jr).

## Changes

- **NKRO is enabled by default** (macOS does not support 6KRO).
- Modify the keyboardâ€™s default layout to macOS key bindings and add some of my preferred shortcuts. Please refer to the key layout attached for details. Feel free to make any modifications in VIA.
- Add VIA support (the firmware for Tofu Jr in the official QMK firmware repository somehow does not have VIA support enabled).

- Change the hardware name to `TOFU65V2`

## How2Use

1. Download the firmware [here](https://github.com/JerryZhangZZY/tofu65v2_macos/releases/latest/download/tofu65v2_macos.uf2)

4. Paste `tofu65v2_macos.uf2` into the pop-up drive.
